## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (latest LTS)
- npm
- Xcode (for Safari only)

### Install and Build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

For continuous rebuilding during development:

```bash
npm run watch
```

After making changes, reload the extension:

- **Chrome**: Click the refresh icon on the extension card in `chrome://extensions/`, then reload the GitHub tab
- **Safari**: Re-run the Xcode project (`Cmd+R`)

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test          # Full test suite (tests + lint + type check + build)
npm run vitest    # Unit tests only
npm run lint      # Linting only
npm run fix       # Auto-fix lint/formatting issues and update snapshots
```

### Updating Feature Snapshots

After adding or modifying a feature, update the generated snapshot files so the options page picks up the changes:

```bash
npm run vitest -- --update
npm run build
```
